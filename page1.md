# About Me
I am Ruby Erickson, a Ph.D. student at Brown University in the Department of Music.  My scholarly interests include music, migration, and diaspora; economic ethnomusicology; voice studies; and engaged research methods. I recently completed my M.A. in Musicology and Ethnomusicology at Brown with a paper theorizing new connections between voice and diaspora scholarship, citing case studies from Cabo Verdean American vocalist interlocutors. I have also just released the first season of a collaborative podcasting project, *Sounds from the Eleventh Star*.
