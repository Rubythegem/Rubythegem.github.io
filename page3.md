# Collaborative Podcasting
## Sounds from the Eleventh Star

*Sounds* is a podcast about Cabo Verdean music in the United States diaspora, featuring lively interviews with those who create, perform, and enjoy these musical traditions. In its first season, available now, the podcast covers topics ranging from Cabo Verdean Carnaval processions, to improvisatory batuku philosophers, to guitar virtuosos! This project is a work of collaborative scholarship, co-hosted by myself and  Cabo Verdean-American performer and scholar Candida Rose Baptista. The podcast is available via the [Orkka International website](https://www.orkkainternational.com/blog11/).
*Thank you to Orkka International, the Capeverdean American Community Development Center, the Cape Verdean Museum, and the Swearer Center at Brown University for your support of this project!*
